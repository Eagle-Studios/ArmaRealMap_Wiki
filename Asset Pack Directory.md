# Asset Pack Directory
Ensure you check if an Asset Pack requires any mods that need downloading in order to use them, before downloading the actual Asset Pack.

If you wish to have your Asset Pack included in this directory, upload it to the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/QXJVwzy8Bj) [#asset-config-sharing](https://discord.com/channels/1135252857227071560/1142672433694908426). Ensure you add additional info (What mods are needed, some kind of screenshot showing off some elements), along with the actual .grma3a file. 
- Files that are contained within Zip folders will not be added!
- Files without any mods required to state so; any file without mod information will not be added. 
- Files may not be added quickly, if it has been more a week since you uploaded your file to discord, and it has not been added here, ping me on the discord ( @c.eagle ) DO NOT DM ME!
