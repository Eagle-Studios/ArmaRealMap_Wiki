# Want to create a map, using GameRealisticMap Studio?

## Important Rules / Guidlines to follow (In this order!)
1. Download GameRealisticMap Studio, from either [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9MTJ3C92Q53C) or [Github Releases](https://github.com/jetelain/ArmaRealMap/releases).
2. Install [Arma 3 tools](Install-required-tools-for-Arma-3) fully and properly.
3. Follow the [Wiki](Create-a-map-for-Arma-3)! (Don't skip steps/do as you want, you will most likely miss something and get stuck).
4. Start small! 
    - Do not jump straight into a huge map and then whinge on the discord (or Arma 's Discord) as to *why is this tool is broken*.
    - Do not start messing around with textures and asset configurations until you actually know what you are doing!
5. Do take the time to read through this guide and maybe even the the original [PMC ArmA 3 Ultimate Terrain Tutorial](https://pmc.editing.wiki/doku.php?id=arma3:terrain:ultimate-terrain-tutorial)
6. Learn how to use [3den Editor](Edit-With-Eden-Editor) to edit terrains.
7. Learn how to use [plopper](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1687651646) to edit terrains.
8. Start messing around with Ground Textures or Asset configurations. 
9. Try a bigger map size. 
    - Do not try stupid map sizes (more than 30km x 30km)
    - Do not try to create a map with heavily wooded or dense cities without creating a suitable asset configuration (Each tree or building has to be scanned in OSM and attempted to be placed by the tool = aka lots and lots and lots of assets (trees are the worst of these))
    - Do remember than bigger map = more work to make look good.
10. Consider publishing on steam?!
    - Please do not publish your 5 minute maps onto steam, The Arma community doesn't want to see these, there is enough crap on the workshop without 5 minute maps.
    - Only publish things that you actually think people might want to download
        - You dont need to publish things that only you are going to use
        - You dont need to publish maps in order to edit them in 3den/plopper.
