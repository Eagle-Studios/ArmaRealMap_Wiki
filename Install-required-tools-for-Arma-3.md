## Mikero's Pbo Project

In previous versions of GameRealisticMap, Mikero's Pbo Project was required to build a read-to-use mod. You can still use it instead of builtin PBO generation tool. See instructions on this page [Install Mikero's Pbo Project](Mikero's-Pbo-Project).

For most users, the builtin PBO generation tool will do the job, you do not need to install Mikero's tool chain.
