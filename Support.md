## Blocked at RawSatellitelImage.S2C (#252, #253)

Windows 10 users might be blocked at "RawSatellitelImage.S2C" due to an "The SSL connection could not be established" error.

The root cause of this error is unknown, as a workaround you can change the configuration to use another S2C source.

Go to settings and change S2Cloudless Base Path to `https://arm.pmad.net/sat/s2cloudless-2020/`
